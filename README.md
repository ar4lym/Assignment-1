Enhypen Website (Project Example Idea 1)
My project is the revamping of the enhypen website, to give enhypen a website of their own instead of the current shared on under Be-lift entertainment. This allows users to be able to easily navigate the website and allow the users to learn about Enhypen without finding it difficult to access the website, like the current one which has both enhypen and illit together in one website.

Design Process
I wanted my website to look simple and professional, such that when users navigate the website and learn more about enhypen, it would feel as if it were the official website promoting enhypen.

Home page- I kept the homepage simple, with as little details as possible, only including a group image as the face of the website, followed by their upcoming scheule, and their latest album release teaser video, encouraging more people to scroll through the website.The inclusion of social media icons in the header allows for users to access their social media.THis is implemented across all pages.

Profile page- Added a statment "We are Enhypen" to allow users to know the main context of the page. This is followed by another group picture, showcasing all 7 members. Scrolling down, users will find 8 individual boxes, 7 of them being the members with their picture and minor details about them such as name, birth date and position in the group. The last box showcases the backbone supporting enhyupen, the CEO, with his picture.Hovering over the boxes causes them to enlargen by a little bit, brining the users focus to the box which the cursor is hovering on.

About Page- Upon entering the about page, users are once again greeted with a group picture of enhypen. Scrolling down would allow the user to learn more about the history of enhypen, such as their debut date, small introcution to the group, members names and a list of the awards they have obtained throughout 2020-2022

Album Page- The Album page showcases the Albums of enhypen, with the one in the middle, being the latest release of enhypen, hence being the biggest. Upon clicking on each of the albums, users will be brought to the individual album pages, with the thought process of how each album was created, followed by their Official MV's, Concept Films and Track Videos.
