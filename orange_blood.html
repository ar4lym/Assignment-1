            <p>K-pop powerhouse ENHYPEN are back with 5th Mini Album ‘ORANGE BLOOD’ Since their debut album, ENHYPEN
                have conveyed their innermost stories through their unique narrative and concepts. The ‘BLOOD’ series
                unfolded a new narrative, which introduced the seven boys determined to make sacrifices for the
                blood-bound ‘you.’ Now, the pioneering storytellers are set to continue their journey and invite the
                global listeners to join their fantastical universe of ‘ORANGE BLOOD.’ ‘ORANGE BLOOD’ carries on the
                narrative initiated in ‘DARK BLOOD,’ wherein the boys, having once forgotten ‘you’ due to their
                ignorance, experience a profound awakening and pledge to sacrifice themselves for ‘you.’ Upon losing
                their power that once seemed eternal, the boys come to a profound awakening that nothing lasts forever.
                With this newfound realization, the boys wholeheartedly commit to loving ‘you’ as if there’s no
                tomorrow, just like the saying ‘Carpe diem.’ Through the warm and comforting radiance of orange light,
                ‘ORANGE BLOOD’ aims to convey the boys’ unwavering determination. By interweaving their personal
                narrative with that of the album and ‘DARK MOON: THE BLOOD ALTAR,’ the seven-piece act expands their
                artistry beyond music, laying the foundation for the next form of entertainment. The album features a
                lineup of seven genre-spanning tracks: “Mortal,” “Sweet Venom,” “Still Monster,” “Blind,” and “Orange
                Flower (You Complete Me).” The lead single “Sweet Venom” serves as a continuation of “Bite Me,” the lead
                single of ‘DARK BLOOD.’ After proving their love through sacrifice and coming to terms with the finite
                and mortal nature of the world, the boys pledge to remain by your side even as poison courses through
                their veins. Masterfully crafted with ENHYPEN’s distinctive concept and high-quality music, ‘ORANGE
                BLOOD’ is poised to be the album that resonates with listeners worldwide.</p>
